# DERIVED TABLED : A derived table is a subquery used inside the FROM clause.
# The subquery behaves like a temporary table.

-- Find customers whose total payment is greater than 150
-- Inner query creates a temporary table with customer total payment

# Correlated Subquery: A correlated subquery depends on the outer query.
# Normal subquery: inner query can run alone.
# Correlated subquery: inner query uses value from outer query.

# Correlated Subquery with Bridge Table: A bridge table connects two tables.

-- Find films that have actor “NICK WAHLBERG”
-- actor table has actor details
-- film_actor connects actor and film
-- film table has film title

-- category table has category name
-- film_category connects category and film
-- film table gives title

-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- When will a Subquery fail ?
-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	-- 1. it returns multiple rows where only one row is expected
-- This subquery returns MANY category_ids
-- But '=' expects only ONE value
SELECT title
FROM film
WHERE film_id = ( # corrected version : WHERE film_id IN (
    SELECT film_id
    FROM film_category 
);
-- this failed because '=' expects one value, but subquery return multiple values

	-- 2. it returns multiple columns where one column is expected
SELECT title
FROM film
WHERE film_id = (
    SELECT film_id, category_id
    FROM film_category # use LIMIT 1, to mitigate the error.
);


	-- 3. wrong placement of subquery
SELECT
FROM (
    SELECT *
    FROM actor
);
-- this failed becasue Derived tables MUST have alias names.
-- corrected version is 
-- SELECT *
-- FROM (
--     SELECT *
--     FROM actor
-- ) AS actor_table;

	-- 4. data type mismatch
    
	-- 5. using aggregate incorrectly
SELECT first_name
FROM customer
WHERE SUM(store_id) > 1;
-- SUM() cannot be used directly inside WHERE. Aggregate functions work AFTER grouping.
