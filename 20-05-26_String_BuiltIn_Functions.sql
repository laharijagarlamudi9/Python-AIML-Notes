-- First adds * on the left to make length 10
-- Then adds - on the right to make length 15

-- In SQL indexing starts from '1' not '0'

-- NOT REGEXP: Used to exclude pattern matching results
-- Shows actors whose first_name does not start with A

-- STRING FUNCTIONS COMBINED EXAMPLE

FROM actor;
-- LEFT gets first letter
-- UPPER converts first letter to capital
-- SUBSTRING gets remaining letters
-- LOWER converts remaining letters to lowercase
-- CONCAT joins first name and last name

-- Displays multiple string operations on film title
SELECT title,
